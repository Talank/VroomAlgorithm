Taxi fare algorithm development for vroom

# About the repo
Different algorithms used for ride sharing app "VROOM" is available in this repo. The file [geofences.json](shareRideAlgorithm/geofences.json) contains data of polygons used to define virtual perimeters in the city of Pokhara, Nepal. And the winding number algorithm has live demo to demonstrate how this algorithm is used to find if a point is lying inside certain geo-fence or not.

More details on how each of the included algorithm works has been commented in the code itself. And for further information please view this [blog](https://dev.to/talank/ride-sharing-and-vehicle-tracking-with-geo-fencing-technique-132a)
